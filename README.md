| ----------- | ----------- |
| <a href=""> <img src="https://github.com/0bvim/42-project-badges/blob/main/badges/get_next_linee.png?raw=true" /></a> | The goal of this project is simple: program a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor. Calling the get_next_line function repeatedly (for example, using a loop) allows the contents of the file pointed to by the file descriptor to be read, line by line, until the end.|
